# Gem in a Box â€“ Really simple rubygem hosting

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/geminabox/geminabox/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/geminabox/geminabox)

Geminabox lets you host your own gems, and push new gems to it just like with rubygems.org.
The bundler dependencies API is supported out of the box.
Authentication is left up to either the web server, or the Rack stack.
For basic auth, try [Rack::Auth](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/rack/rack/Rack/Auth/Basic).

## System Requirements

See [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) for supported ruby versions

## Server Setup

    gem install geminabox

Create a config.ru as follows:

    require "rubygems"
    require "geminabox"

    Geminabox.data = "/var/geminabox-data" # ... or wherever
    run Geminabox::Server

Start your gem server with 'rackup' to run WEBrick or hook up the config.ru as you normally would ([passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/), [thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), [unicorn](https://bogomips.org/unicorn/), whatever floats your boat).

## Legacy RubyGems index

RubyGems supports generating indexes for the so called legacy versions (< 1.2), and since it is very rare to use such versions nowadays, it can be disabled, thus improving indexing times for large repositories. If it's safe for your application, you can disable support for these legacy versions by adding the following configuration to your config.ru file:

    Geminabox.build_legacy = false

## RubyGems Proxy

Geminabox can be configured to pull gems, it does not currently have, from rubygems.org. To enable this mode you can either:

Set RUBYGEM_PROXY to true in the environment:

    RUBYGEMS_PROXY=true rackup

Or in config.ru (before the run command), set:

    Geminabox.rubygems_proxy = true

If you want Geminabox to carry on providing gems when rubygems.org is unavailable, add this to config.ru:

    Geminabox.allow_remote_failure = true

## HTTP adapter

Geminabox uses the HTTPClient gem to manage its connections to remote resources.
The relationship is managed via Geminabox::HttpClientAdapter.

If you would like to use an alternative HTTP gem, create your own adapter
and specify it in config.ru:

    Geminabox.http_adapter = YourHttpAdapter.new

It is recommend (but not essential) that your adapter inherits from HttpAdapter.
The adapter will need to replace HttpAdapter's methods with those specific to
the alternative HTTP gem. It should also be able to handle HTTP proxy
settings.

Defining your own adapter also allows you to configure Geminabox to use the
local systems SSL certificates.

TemplateFaradayAdapter is provided as an example of an alternative HTTPAdapter.

## Client Usage

Since version 0.10, Geminabox supports the standard gemcutter push API:

    gem push pkg/my-awesome-gem-1.0.gem --host HOST

You can also use the gem plugin:

    gem install geminabox

    gem inabox pkg/my-awesome-gem-1.0.gem

Configure Gem in a box (interactive prompt to specify where to upload to):

    gem inabox -c

Change the host to upload to:

    gem inabox -g HOST

Simples!

## Docker

Using Gem in a Box is really simple with the Dockerfile.  Move this Dockerfile into a directory that you want to use for your server.

That directory only needs to contain:

```
config.ru (explained above)
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
```

Your Gemfile only needs:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'geminabox'
```

From there

```
docker build -t geminabox .
```

```
docker run -d -p 9292:9292 geminabox:latest
```

Your server should now be running!
